# DKC-Blindspot-Blitz
A DKC ROM hack

This is a challenge hack with a very simple goal: beat the game with reduced vision. At the start of every entrance, your camera is maxed out temporarily. The shrinking speed is the same for all 3 modes. Only the amount differs. Collecting bananas gives a temporary boost to your vision. Either getting a 1-up from bananas or collecting a balloon temporarily maxes your vision.

# KNOWN BUGS
There is a slight glitch in cave levels where the left side of the screen (behind you) does not shrink.
