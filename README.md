# DKC-Blindspot-Blitz
A DKC ROM hack

This is a challenge hack with a very simple goal: beat the game with reduced vision. At the start of every entrance, your camera is maxed out temporarily. The shrinking speed is the same for all 3 modes. Only the amount differs. Collecting bananas gives a temporary boost to your vision. Either getting a 1-up from bananas or collecting a balloon temporarily maxes your vision.

Changing the difficulty can be changed anytime by pressing l or r on the overworld.

Start select works globally. It even works on bosses! Except for K Rool, since he is the only stage accessed from the outer world map. This allows you to 'pause out' of levels you haven't beaten yet.

# KNOWN BUGS
There is a slight glitch in cave levels where the left side of the screen (behind you) does not shrink. This is not major and it doesn't help you in the fordwards direction, so it is not a big deal.
